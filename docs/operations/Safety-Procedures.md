# Safety Procedures

## Overview

This comprehensive safety guide establishes mandatory safety procedures, protocols, and best practices for all PLC automation systems in the repository. Safety is the highest priority in industrial automation, and these procedures must be followed at all times to protect personnel, equipment, and the environment.

## Safety Philosophy

### Fundamental Safety Principles
1. **Life Safety First**: Human life takes precedence over all other considerations
2. **Zero Harm Goal**: Target of zero injuries and incidents
3. **Risk-Based Approach**: Systematic identification and mitigation of hazards
4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple independent layers of protection
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Learn from incidents and near-misses
6. **Personal Responsibility**: Every individual is responsible for safety

### Hierarchy of Controls
```
1. Elimination: Remove the hazard completely
2. Substitution: Replace with less dangerous alternative
3. Engineering Controls: Physical safeguards and barriers
4. Administrative Controls: Procedures and training
5. Personal Protective Equipment: Last line of defense
```

## Regulatory Compliance

### Applicable Standards and Codes
- **OSHA 29 CFR 1910**: Occupational Safety and Health Standards
- **NFPA 70E**: Electrical Safety in the Workplace
- **IEC 61508**: Functional Safety of Safety-Related Systems
- **IEC 61511**: Functional Safety - Safety Instrumented Systems
- **ISA-84**: Application of Safety Instrumented Systems
- **ANSI/RIA R15.06**: Industrial Robot Safety Standards

### Safety Integrity Levels (SIL)
```
SIL 4: 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁴ (Highest safety integrity)
SIL 3: 10⁻⁴ to 10⁻³ 
SIL 2: 10⁻³ to 10⁻²
SIL 1: 10⁻² to 10⁻¹ (Lowest safety integrity)
```

## Electrical Safety

### Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) Procedures

#### Energy Isolation Requirements
```
Before ANY electrical work:
1. Identify all energy sources
2. Notify affected personnel
3. Shut down equipment properly
4. Isolate all energy sources
5. Apply lockout devices
6. Tag all isolation points
7. Verify zero energy state
8. Test verification equipment
```

#### LOTO Implementation Steps
```
Step 1: Preparation
□ Review equipment drawings and procedures
□ Identify all energy sources (electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic)
□ Gather required LOTO devices and PPE
□ Notify operations and maintenance personnel
□ Obtain necessary permits and approvals

Step 2: Shutdown
□ Follow normal equipment shutdown sequence
□ Verify all processes are stopped safely
□ Check that all moving parts have stopped
□ Ensure system is in safe, stable state
□ Document shutdown completion

Step 3: Isolation
□ Open all electrical disconnects
□ Close all pneumatic isolation valves
□ Block all hydraulic flow paths
□ Isolate stored energy sources (capacitors, springs)
□ Verify isolation points are accessible

Step 4: Lockout Application
□ Apply locks to all isolation devices
□ Each worker applies their own lock
□ Use standardized lockout devices
□ Ensure locks cannot be removed without key
□ Verify locks are properly secured

Step 5: Tagging
□ Attach tags to all locked devices
□ Include date, time, and worker identification
□ Describe work being performed
□ List expected completion time
□ Use durable, legible tags

Step 6: Verification
□ Test operation of equipment controls
□ Verify equipment will not start
□ Use appropriate test equipment
□ Check for stored energy discharge
□ Confirm zero energy state
```
