# Seawater Desalination and Water Distribution System

This is a complete PLC control system for a seawater desalination plant with water treatment and distribution to roof tanks.

## System Overview

The system consists of:
1. **Seawater Intake** - Raw seawater collection and pre-filtration
2. **Pre-Treatment** - Sediment and chemical filtration
3. **Reverse Osmosis (RO)** - Main desalination process
4. **Post-Treatment** - Mineralization and disinfection
5. **Storage System** - Ground and roof tank management
6. **Distribution Network** - Pressurized water distribution
