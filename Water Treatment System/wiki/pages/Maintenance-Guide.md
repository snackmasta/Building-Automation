## ðŸ§½ Membrane Cleaning Procedures

### When to Clean Membranes
**Cleaning Indicators:**
- Normalized differential pressure increase >15%
- Normalized permeate flow decrease >10%
- Normalized salt passage increase >5-10%
- Scheduled interval (typically 3-6 months)

### CIP (Clean-in-Place) Procedure
**Duration:** 4-6 hours  
**Frequency:** As needed based on performance

#### Step 1: Preparation (30 minutes)
1. **System Preparation**
   ```
   â†’ Reduce feed flow gradually
   â†’ Stop high-pressure pumps
   â†’ Drain system to cleaning tank level
   â†’ Verify cleaning chemical availability
   ```

2. **Safety Preparation**
   - Review MSDS for cleaning chemicals
   - Ensure proper PPE availability
   - Check emergency shower/eyewash stations
   - Notify all personnel of cleaning operation

#### Step 2: Low pH Cleaning (90 minutes)
**Chemical:** Citric acid (2% solution) or HCl (0.5%)
**Temperature:** 25-30Â°C  
**Flow Rate:** 40-60% of normal operating flow

1. **Circulation Phase**
   - Circulate cleaning solution for 60 minutes
   - Monitor pH and temperature continuously
   - Record cleaning solution appearance changes

2. **Soaking Phase**
   - Stop circulation, allow 30-minute soak
   - Maintain temperature and monitor pH
   - Resume circulation for final 15 minutes

#### Step 3: Intermediate Rinse (15 minutes)
- Flush with RO permeate or DI water
- Continue until pH returns to neutral (6.5-7.5)
- Check conductivity to ensure complete rinse

#### Step 4: High pH Cleaning (90 minutes)
**Chemical:** NaOH (0.1-0.5%) + surfactant
**Temperature:** 35-40Â°C  
**Flow Rate:** 40-60% of normal operating flow

1. **Circulation and Soak**
   - Same procedure as low pH cleaning
   - Monitor pH (target 11-12)
   - Watch for organic matter removal

#### Step 5: Final Rinse and Return to Service (30 minutes)
- Rinse with RO permeate until neutral pH
- Gradually return to normal operating conditions
- Monitor initial product quality closely
- Record post-cleaning performance data

### Cleaning Solution Disposal
- **pH Neutralization:** Adjust to pH 6-9 before discharge
- **Environmental Compliance:** Follow local discharge regulations
- **Documentation:** Record chemical usage and disposal

## ðŸ”© Component Replacement Procedures

### RO Membrane Replacement
**Frequency:** 3-7 years depending on water quality  
**Duration:** 4-8 hours per vessel

#### Pre-Replacement Steps
1. **Planning Phase**
   - Order compatible membrane elements
   - Schedule during planned shutdown
   - Prepare tools and lifting equipment
   - Review vessel entry procedures

2. **System Preparation**
   - Complete full system shutdown
   - Drain pressure vessels completely
   - Apply lockout/tagout procedures
   - Prepare membrane preservation solution

#### Replacement Procedure
1. **Vessel Opening**
   ```
   â†’ Remove end cap bolts (torque sequence)
   â†’ Use proper lifting equipment for end cap
   â†’ Inspect o-rings and sealing surfaces
   â†’ Document existing membrane condition
   ```

2. **Membrane Removal**
   - Remove interconnect tubes carefully
   - Extract membranes using proper pulling technique
   - Inspect for damage or unusual fouling
   - Photograph for warranty documentation

3. **Installation of New Membranes**
   - Verify membrane orientation (feed end marking)
   - Install new interconnect tubes
   - Apply proper lubricant to o-rings
   - Check membrane seating in vessel

4. **Vessel Closure**
   - Install new o-rings if required
   - Replace end cap with proper torque sequence
   - Pressure test at 1.5x operating pressure
   - Complete leak check

#### Post-Replacement Commissioning
- Perform low-pressure flush (2-4 hours)
- Remove membrane preservative completely
- Gradually increase to operating pressure
- Monitor initial performance closely
- Document baseline performance data

### Pump Seal Replacement
**Frequency:** 1-2 years depending on operation  
**Duration:** 2-4 hours

#### Safety Procedures
- Complete pump lockout/tagout
- Relieve all system pressure
- Allow pump to cool if recently operated
- Prepare spill containment materials

#### Replacement Steps
1. **Disassembly**
   - Disconnect pump from piping
   - Remove pump coupling
   - Extract pump cartridge from casing
   - Disassemble seal components

2. **Inspection and Cleaning**
   - Check shaft for wear or damage
   - Inspect seal chamber condition
   - Clean all sealing surfaces
   - Verify flush system operation

3. **Installation**
   - Install new seal per manufacturer instructions
   - Use proper installation tools
   - Apply specified torque values
   - Check shaft alignment

4. **Testing**
