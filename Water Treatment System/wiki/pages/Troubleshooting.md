## ⚠️ Common Alarms and Solutions

### High Pressure Alarms

#### HPA-001: RO High Pressure (>65 bar)
**Possible Causes:**
- Fouled or blocked RO membranes
- Closed or restricted reject valve
- High-pressure pump over-speed
- Downstream valve restriction

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Check reject valve position (should be 20-30% open)
2. Verify pump speed setpoint (target 50-60 bar)
3. Review membrane differential pressure
4. Check for downstream restrictions

**Solution:**
```
If membrane fouling suspected:
→ Initiate cleaning cycle
→ Review pre-treatment effectiveness
→ Consider membrane replacement if cleaning ineffective
```

#### HPA-002: Feed Pressure Low (<2 bar)
**Possible Causes:**
- Raw water supply interruption
- Intake pump failure
- Suction line blockage
- Pre-filter restriction

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Check raw water supply availability
2. Verify intake pump operation
3. Inspect suction strainer
4. Check pre-filter differential pressure

### Water Quality Issues

#### WQA-001: High Product TDS (>250 ppm)
**Symptoms:**
- Conductivity alarm on product water
- Poor taste or appearance
- Failed quality tests

**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. **Membrane Integrity Check**
   - Perform membrane probing test
   - Check for o-ring failures
   - Inspect pressure vessel seals

2. **System Bypass Check**
   - Verify all bypass valves are closed
   - Check sampling point isolation
   - Confirm product/reject separation

**Corrective Actions:**
```
Short-term: 
→ Increase reject flow rate
→ Reduce recovery rate to <40%
→ Isolate affected membrane elements

Long-term:
→ Replace damaged membranes
→ Improve pre-treatment
→ Review chemical cleaning program
```

#### WQA-002: Low Product Flow (<8 m³/h)
**Possible Causes:**
- Membrane fouling or scaling
- High system backpressure
- Pump cavitation
- Valve misalignment

**Investigation Process:**
1. Check all flow meter readings
2. Monitor pump performance curves
3. Review pressure drop across membranes
4. Verify valve positions

## 🔧 Equipment-Specific Troubleshooting

### High-Pressure Pumps

#### Problem: Pump Cavitation
**Symptoms:**
- Erratic pressure readings
- Unusual noise or vibration
- Reduced flow rate
- High motor current

**Solutions:**
1. **Suction Issues**
   - Check suction pressure (min 2 bar)
   - Clean suction strainer
   - Verify pump priming
   - Check for air leaks

2. **NPSH Issues**
   - Reduce suction line losses
   - Lower pump speed if possible
   - Check fluid temperature

#### Problem: Seal Leakage
**Symptoms:**
- Visible water leakage
- Pressure loss
- Contamination of seal area

**Actions:**
1. **Immediate:**
   - Reduce operating pressure
   - Increase seal flush flow
   - Monitor leak rate

2. **Planned Maintenance:**
   - Schedule seal replacement
   - Inspect wear patterns
   - Check shaft alignment

### Control System Issues

#### Problem: HMI Communication Loss
**Symptoms:**
- Blank or frozen HMI screens
- "Communication Error" messages
- Unable to change setpoints

**Troubleshooting:**
1. **Network Check**
   ```
   → Verify Ethernet cable connections
   → Check network switch status lights
   → Ping PLC from HMI station
   → Restart network equipment if needed
   ```

2. **System Restart**
   - Save current screen (if possible)
   - Restart HMI software
   - Cycle PLC power if necessary
   - Reload last known good configuration

#### Problem: Sensor Reading Errors
**Common Sensors:**
- Pressure transmitters
- Flow meters
- Conductivity probes
- Temperature sensors

**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. **Electrical Check**
   - Verify 24VDC power supply
   - Check signal wiring integrity
   - Measure loop current (4-20mA)
   - Test sensor isolation

2. **Calibration Verification**
   - Compare with portable instruments
   - Check zero and span calibration
   - Review calibration certificates
   - Perform field calibration if needed

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### Major Water Leak
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Emergency stop all pumps
   - Isolate affected section
   - Evacuate area if necessary
   - Notify emergency contacts

2. **Assessment**
   - Identify leak source and severity
   - Assess structural damage risk
   - Determine repair requirements
   - Plan temporary measures

### Power Failure
1. **During Outage**
   - System automatically shuts down safely
   - UPS maintains control system for 30 minutes
   - Monitor emergency lighting and communications

2. **Power Restoration**
   - Wait 5 minutes before restart
   - Check all equipment status
   - Perform standard startup procedure
   - Monitor for any damage or issues
