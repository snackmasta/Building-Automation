# Operating Procedures

## üè≠ Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

### SOP-001: Daily Startup Procedure
**Duration:** 15-20 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** System in standby, utilities available

1. **Pre-startup Checks**
   - Verify electrical power availability
   - Check raw water supply pressure (min 2 bar)
   - Confirm all emergency stops are reset
   - Review alarm history from previous shutdown

2. **System Startup Sequence**
   ```
   Step 1: Enable main electrical supply
   Step 2: Start pre-treatment pumps
   Step 3: Initialize cleaning cycle (if required)
   Step 4: Start high-pressure pumps
   Step 5: Begin production mode
   ```

3. **Startup Verification**
   - Monitor system pressures within normal range
   - Verify product water quality meets specifications
   - Confirm all process indicators are green

### SOP-002: Normal Production Operation
**Monitoring Frequency:** Every 2 hours

#### Key Process Parameters
| Parameter | Normal Range | Action Required |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Feed Pressure | 4-6 bar | Adjust intake pump speed |
| RO Pressure | 50-60 bar | Check high-pressure pumps |
| Product Flow | 8-12 m¬≥/h | Verify membrane condition |
| Recovery Rate | 40-50% | Optimize reject valve |
| Product TDS | <250 ppm | Check membrane integrity |

#### Routine Checks
- **Hourly:** Check pressures, flows, and product quality
- **Every 4 hours:** Record process data in log book
- **Daily:** Inspect equipment for leaks or unusual noise
- **Weekly:** Review performance trends and maintenance needs

### SOP-003: Normal Shutdown Procedure
**Duration:** 10-15 minutes

1. **Controlled Shutdown**
   - Reduce production flow gradually over 5 minutes
   - Stop high-pressure pumps
   - Continue pre-treatment circulation for 3 minutes
   - Stop all pumps and close isolation valves

2. **Post-shutdown Tasks**
   - Record final operating parameters
   - Complete daily log entries
   - Set system to standby mode
   - Secure facility and equipment

### SOP-004: Emergency Shutdown
**Duration:** Immediate (30 seconds)

#### Emergency Conditions
- High pressure alarm (>65 bar)
- Low product quality (>500 ppm TDS)
- Equipment failure or safety hazard
- Power loss or electrical fault

#### Emergency Actions
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Press emergency stop button
   - Secure area and ensure personnel safety
   - Notify supervisor and maintenance team
   - Document incident in emergency log

2. **Investigation and Recovery**
   - Identify root cause of emergency
   - Perform safety inspection before restart
   - Complete incident report
   - Obtain supervisor approval for restart

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Procedures

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
- **Minimum PPE:** Safety glasses, steel-toe boots
- **Chemical Handling:** Chemical-resistant gloves, apron
- **Electrical Work:** Arc-rated clothing, insulated tools
- **Confined Space:** Full safety harness, gas detector

### Lockout/Tagout (LOTO)
1. **Preparation**
   - Identify all energy sources
   - Notify all affected personnel
   - Obtain proper LOTO devices

2. **Execution**
   - De-energize all energy sources
   - Apply locks and tags to each source
   - Verify zero energy state
   - Proceed with work safely

### Chemical Safety
- **Storage:** Keep chemicals in original containers
- **Handling:** Use proper PPE and ventilation
- **Spills:** Follow spill response procedures
- **MSDS:** Review safety data sheets before use

## üìä Process Optimization

### Water Quality Optimization
- Monitor conductivity trends for membrane fouling
- Adjust pre-treatment chemical dosing as needed
- Optimize recovery rate for energy efficiency
- Schedule cleaning cycles based on performance

### Energy Efficiency
- Use variable frequency drives for pump optimization
- Monitor specific energy consumption (kWh/m¬≥)
- Balance recovery rate vs energy consumption
- Schedule operation during off-peak electricity hours

## üìù Documentation Requirements

### Daily Logs
- Operating parameters and setpoints
- Product water quality results
- Equipment status and alarms
- Chemical consumption and additions

### Weekly Reports
- Performance summary and trends
- Maintenance activities completed
- Chemical inventory and usage
- Energy consumption analysis
